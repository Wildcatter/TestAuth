5) How to deal with adding favorites
	1) The info to submit along with the favorite

7) Where to put the login form link on the main page

	Do a dropdown


8) Put search feedback in heading area of dashboard page
	Matt

9) Homepage:
	1) user submits the search form
		Matt
	2) user just clicks the login link
		-after they are authenticated, Garett-style, then redirect to dashboard page
		- a) have default events, OR
		- b) no events at all, "Welcome to your event page"
		Garett

	3) Dashboard page facebook content
	Garett

10) The search form on dashbaord page will be a modal with same inputs as main homescreen form

11) Manage favorites section
	
	Note:  maybe just put this functionality inside of the favorites slider (like delete and edit icon)

	-here they can:
